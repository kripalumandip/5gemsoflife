        <div class="point1">
            <h1>Never be over excited</h1>
            <p>If you are a type of person who becomes over excited in your life if some change is going to happen then
                you have to change your habit because this habit has the following disadvantages</p>
            <button class="btn" id="btn1" onclick="showhide1()">Show more</button>
            <p id="para1">

                You will feel shame if that change is a mistake. for eg. think what will happen if you go to stage in
                front of every one to receive an award which is to be given to a person with the name similar to you and
                you mistakely heard your name. Imagine the situation. <br>
                Another demerit is that every thing you posses now will be anyway snatched from you. It is for sure.
                Either some other people will snatch that from you or the time will snatch your body(being dead). If you
                are very excited about what you have then you will feel very bad when it is snatched.

            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="point1">
            <h1>Dont waste your time in the name of entertainment</h1>
            <p>Among these two only one can exist and they are either success or entertainment.</p>
            <button class="btn" id="btn1" onclick="showhide2()">Show more</button>
            <p id="para2">
                One simple rule, if you want to be successful then forget about your entertainment and if you want to
                enjoy your life then forget about the success. Some people can tell that we are successful and we enjoy
                our life as well then I would reply them as "please ask your soul that you feel really successful while
                enjoying the life in the form of ignorance." This is nor success, this is the way of killing yourself
                because no matter how successful you think you are one day time will snatch your body from you so before
                that its better to work hard on life rather than enjoying the life in the form of ignorance.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="point1">
            <h1>Never be angry for a longer time</h1>
            <p>Every one becomes angry when their wish is not fulfilled. But being angry for a longer time is super
                harmful for you because</p>
            <button class="btn" id="btn3" onclick="showhide3()">Show more</button>
            <p id="para3">

                When we become angry then generally we are angry with two classes. One is the living beings like human,
                dog, cat, etc. and another class is the non living class like I am very angry with the earthquake
                because it destroyed my house. Both the living and non living are the material world and if you become
                angry with them then your mind will go into those things and you will gain the property of those things.
                for eg. if i hate bad person too much then one thing is sure that i will become bad because i have been
                thinking about him so i am becoming like him. So never be angry or hate someone for a longer time, just
                finish the matter in a shorter time.
                </ul>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="point1">
            <h1>Never cry for the worldly loss</h1>
            <p>If you are the kind of person who cries for the worldly loss then it is a clear sign that you have lost
                the will to rise again. </p>
            <button class="btn" id="btn4" onclick="showhide4()">Show more</button>
            <p id="para4">

                The life is a battle and it will make you fall down but it is upto you either to rise again or to
                accepet the defeat and cry for the whole life. We plan for one thing and suddenly another new thing
                happens then our best move is to adjust according the situation and keep pressing our attack from that
                situation. And nothing to worry about in the worldly loss because one day everything will be snatched
                from you even your life so just focus on your effort and dont think about the result. Make a will to
                prepare not the will to win.
                </ul>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="point1">
            <h1>Dont expect anything from the world</h1>
            <p>As there is one famous quotation "There are no free lunches" so we must not think that someone will give
                us things in our life to run our life. </p>
            <button class="btn" id="btn5" onclick="showhide5()">Show more</button>
            <p id="para5">

                This thinking is totally disastrous as in the world everyone in mean from inside though they seem
                generous from outside. Remember one golden statement "No one in this universe can even think for the
                happiness of the others then how could they do things for the happiness of others." We can see countless
                examples in the world like everyone respects a strong and wealthy person but when he becomes weak and
                poor no one will look at him. This is the reality of the world. No matter we can see false etiquete in
                the world but the reality is everyone is selfist. Our job is to understand and realise this fact and to
                work hard on our own and never to expect anything from the world.
                </ul>
